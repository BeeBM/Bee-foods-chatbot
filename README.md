**Bee Foods Chatbot**
## **Brief Description**
The purpose of this chatbot is to allow customers to place orders for meals in Bee Foods (a restaurant) through a chat interface. The chatbot interface is designed using HTML and the chat functionality is implemented using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io.

The front-end of the chatbot is designed using HTML and consists of a chat area where messages are displayed, and an input field where customers can enter their messages. The messages are sent to the server using Socket.io.

On the server-side, the chatbot is implemented using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io. When a customer sends a message, the server receives the message and processes it. The server can emit responses to the customer based on the message received.

To enable user sessions based on devices, the chatbot uses the express-session middleware. This allows the chatbot to store user sessions on the server, and associate them with specific devices.

To validate inputs from customers, the chatbot uses regular expressions to match specific patterns in the messages received. If the message matches a specific pattern, the server can emit a response to the customer based on the message received.

Here is a summary of the code:
1. The front-end of the chatbot is designed using HTML and consists of a chat area and an input field.
2. The chat functionality is implemented using Socket.io. When a message is sent, it is received by the server using Socket.io.
3. The server uses the express-session middleware to enable user sessions based on devices.
4. To validate inputs from customers, the server uses regular expressions to match specific patterns in the messages received.
5. If the message matches a specific pattern, the server can emit a response to the customer based on the message received.

Overall, the chatbot allows customers to place orders for meals in a restaurant through a chat interface. The chatbot interface is designed using HTML, and the chat functionality is implemented using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io. The chatbot also uses the express-session middleware to enable user sessions based on devices, and regular expressions to validate inputs from customers.
